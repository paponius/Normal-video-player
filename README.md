# Normal video player

Some sites tend to limit what a user can do with video player. It's important a user won't click away, skip AD, sometimes even reverse/forward, switch full-screen, change speed. While the video window is covered with a shade, some icons, text in an all-together mash. The video starts playing right away, but muted, as that's the rules applied by specifications of the web (bad people banning free, but uninvited speech)

This script fixes that.

- no overlays (on Desktop)
- no video shades
- normal video controls
- possibility to reverse/forward - seek
- possibility to switch to full-screen
- possibility to change speed
- possibility to block next video (not yet)


## Sites (so far)
facebook.com/reels/  
instagram.com/reels/  
google.com/shorts/    it adds a button to redirect to normal YouTube player. (this is not yet implemented)

Additional step on Chrome: right-click the TamperMonkey icon on browser toolbar > Manage > "Allow user script"
